# Design
The design process was structured using the five planes of UX - **Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface**. Each Section is discussed more in depth in the Design document in the repository, which can be found [here](DESIGN.md). A summary will be outlined below.

From brainstorming sessions and using design thinking a central site goal emerged:
-  **Site Goal**.

# Marketing
Seoda By Sophie is a small business run by one individual and the goal is to turn a hobby into a profit-making enterprise. As a result the web marketing strategies chosen are free and low-cost/targeted expense. The main strands of this campaign are:

  - SEO and content marketing
  - Organic Social Media marketing
  - Scheduled Paid Social Media marketing
  - Email Newsletter subscription

## SEO
The implementation of SEO best practices in this site are as follows:
  - Use of semantic HTML
  - Avoiding keyword stuffing
  - Adding meta information in head element
  - Ensuring images have alt descriptions
  - Adding rel attribute with noopener to external links

Key words included short-tail and long-tail and were decided on using a combination of google search recommendations, google trends and free features of [wordtracker.com](https://www.wordtracker.com/)

2 additional files, sitemap.xml and robots.txt, were added to assist search engines like Google understand the website structure and state the scope of the SEO search to be carried out.

##  Social Media
Seoda By Sophie has two main social media presences; [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seodabysophie/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61552129821660).

An Instagram account was already created for the business and contains photos of products, customer testimonials and informational content

A Facebook business page was created while creating this website and contains business info and a link to the online store

|:--:|
|Instagram Page 1|

| ![Facebook Page 2](/assets/readme_images/fb_screenshot_2.png) |

|Facebook Page 2|

These social media pages are intended to engage with customers and share content that organically grows an audience. This free form of marketing is the most useful to the business at its current stage. 

Paid or sponsored posts will be used strategically to market products, such as coming up to gift-buying periods like Valentines Day and Christmas or when products are low in stock and it is a customer's last chance to buy.

## Newsletter
A newsletter was implemented in the footer of the site using Mailchimp. This gives a user a chance to subscribe to hear about new products or promotions and is a cost-effective method of marketing to customers who are interested in the products offered on the site.
